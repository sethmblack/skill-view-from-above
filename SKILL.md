## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| current_problem | Yes | What's consuming the user's attention |
| emotional_state | No | How they're feeling about it |
| context | No | Why this feels so significant |

## The Stoic Framework

Marcus Aurelius practiced the "view from above"—a visualization technique that places individual concerns within the vastness of space and time. As he wrote:

> "Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them."

And:

> "Think of the whole of existence, of which you are the tiniest part; think of the whole of time, in which you have been assigned a brief and fleeting moment."

### Why It Works

1. **Cognitive distance:** Physical and temporal distance reduces emotional intensity
2. **Proportion:** Problems that seemed enormous become appropriately sized
3. **Humility:** Reminds us we are part of something far larger
4. **Continuity:** Others have faced similar challenges throughout history
5. **Peace:** The vastness of existence contains space for our troubles

### The Practice

The view from above progressively expands perspective:
- From the immediate situation
- To your life as a whole
- To your community and era
- To human history
- To the cosmos and eternity

## Visualization Steps

### Step 1: Acknowledge the Present Problem
Don't deny or minimize what you're feeling. Name it clearly.

### Step 2: Rise Above Your Current Location
Imagine viewing yourself from above—in this room, this building, this neighborhood.

### Step 3: Expand to Your City and Region
See the thousands of lives being lived simultaneously. Others sleeping, working, loving, struggling.

### Step 4: View the Earth from Space
The pale blue dot. Seven billion people, countless struggles, joys, dramas—all contained on this sphere.

### Step 5: Place in Time
Consider: This same problem has been faced by countless people before you. In a hundred years, new generations will face similar challenges. Your moment is brief.

### Step 6: Contemplate the Cosmos
Stars beyond counting, time beyond measure. Your problem exists—real, valid—but also small against this immensity.

### Step 7: Return with Perspective
Come back to the present moment, carrying the peace of cosmic perspective.

## Output Format

```markdown
## View from Above

### Your Current Concern
[What's weighing on you]

### The Visualization Journey

**This Moment:**
Right now, you are [location/situation], feeling [emotion]. This is real. This matters to you.

**Rising Above:**
Imagine floating above your location. You see yourself, a single figure among many. In this building, others work, worry, hope. Each carrying their own concerns.

**The City:**
Wider now—the city stretches below. Thousands of lives unfolding simultaneously. Someone is falling in love. Someone is grieving. Someone is struggling with the exact problem you face. You are not alone in difficulty.

**The Earth:**
From space, the Earth is a luminous sphere. No borders visible. The collective human drama—all the ambitions, fears, conflicts, joys—contained in this blue marble. Your concern exists here, real but proportional.

**Through Time:**
Think of your grandparents. Their concerns, once so pressing, now resolved or irrelevant. Think forward—your grandchildren's concerns, unknown to you now, will feel equally urgent to them. The river of time carries all concerns eventually away.

**The Cosmos:**
Stars beyond counting. Galaxies beyond knowing. Time stretching incomprehensibly. And yet—here you are, conscious, feeling, aware. A brief pattern in the infinite. Your problem is real, but it is also small. Both things are true.

### Returning

You return to this moment, this body, this situation. The problem remains, but you carry something back:

**What Remains True:**
[The valid, real aspects of the concern]

**What Has Shifted:**
[How perspective has changed]

**The Proportion:**
[Where this actually fits in the scheme of things]

### The Stoic Reminder
> [Relevant Marcus Aurelius quote]

### What to Do Now
[Simple, grounded action from this perspective]
```

## Constraints

- This is not about dismissing real problems—proportion, not denial
- Don't use cosmic perspective to avoid necessary action
- The goal is equanimity, not detachment from life
- Return to the present and act appropriately
- Some problems are genuinely serious—perspective helps us face them, not ignore them

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I didn't get the promotion I've been working toward for two years. I'm devastated. I feel like all my work was for nothing."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## View from Above

### Your Current Concern
Not receiving the promotion after two years of dedicated effort. Feeling that work was wasted, questioning your path and worth.

### The Visualization Journey

**This Moment:**
Right now, you sit with disappointment heavy in your chest. Two years of effort, meetings, late nights, hope—and the answer was no. This is real. This disappointment is valid.

**Rising Above:**
Imagine floating upward, out of your room, above your building. You see yourself, a single figure with a single concern. In offices around you, others work, unaware of your struggle. Some received promotions today and feel joy. Some received rejections and feel as you do. The building holds multitudes.

**The City:**
Wider now—the city stretches in every direction. Hundreds of thousands of careers are unfolding. Today, some began new jobs. Some lost jobs. Some received news that changed their paths. Your disappointment joins the vast river of human hope and setback.

**The Earth:**
From space, boundaries disappear. The title you sought exists only in one organization, in one industry, in one country. From here, all of humanity's organizational charts seem like what they are: temporary arrangements we agree to pretend are important. They have their place. But from here, you see their scale.

**Through Time:**
A hundred years ago, someone worked just as hard for a promotion in a company that no longer exists. Their disappointment felt exactly like yours. A hundred years from now, someone will feel this same sting for an opportunity in an organization not yet founded. All of it passes through time.

Marcus Aurelius ruled the entire Roman Empire—and it still fell. Positions, titles, kingdoms: all temporary. What endured was his character and his writing. Two thousand years later, his wisdom helps you tonight.

**The Cosmos:**
Stars burning for billions of years. Light traveling across inconceivable distances. The universe, indifferent and magnificent. And here you are—conscious, feeling, aware. Against this immensity, your promotion is a small thing. But against this immensity, YOU are a remarkable thing—briefly alive, capable of wisdom, capable of choosing who to be.

### Returning

You return to this moment, this body, this situation. The disappointment remains, but perspective has shifted.

**What Remains True:**
- You worked hard
- The rejection is disappointing
- You wanted this and didn't get it
- It's okay to feel sad about that

**What Has Shifted:**
- Two years were not "wasted"—you grew, learned, contributed
- This promotion was not your only path
- Your worth is not determined by this decision
- Others have faced this and found their way

**The Proportion:**
A setback in a career, in an organization, in a moment. Real, but contained. Your character, your growth, your capacity to contribute—these remain untouched by a committee's decision.

### The Stoic Reminder
> "You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength." — Marcus Aurelius

The promotion was outside your control. Your response to this moment is not.

### What to Do Now
Tonight, let yourself feel the disappointment without fighting it. Tomorrow, ask: What did I learn? What doors remain open? What do I actually want? The answers will come clearer in time. For now, rest in the knowledge that you are more than any title, and your work continues.
